This file serves as a second pass at data processing with the aim to prepare and standardize the data that will be used to fit the various models.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
historical_data <- read_csv("data/processed/historical_data.csv",
                            col_types = list(wbic = col_factor(NULL),
                                             month  = col_factor(NULL),
                                             season = col_factor(NULL),
                                             summerkill = col_factor(NULL),
                                             stratification_duration = col_double(),
                                             stratification_onset_yday = col_double(),
                                             stratified_period_count = col_double(),
                                             ice_duration = col_double()))

future_data <- read_csv("data/processed/future_data.csv",
                            col_types = list(wbic = col_factor(NULL),
                                             month  = col_factor(NULL),
                                             season = col_factor(NULL),
                                             stratification_duration = col_double(),
                                             stratification_onset_yday = col_double(),
                                             stratified_period_count = col_double(),
                                             ice_duration = col_double()))
```


```{r}
sum(historical_data$summerkill == "pos")
```
