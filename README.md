### Abstract
As environmental temperatures continue to rise and organisms experience novel and potentially lethal conditions, the possibility of increased mass mortality events for animal populations appears likely. Yet due to die-off rarity and unpredictability, there has been few largescale attempts to quantify the relationship between mass die-offs and local environmental temperatures. Here, we address this issue by analyzing a database of 424 freshwater fish die-offs combined with lake-specific temperature profiles simulated for north temperate lake ecosystems. Die-offs driven by extreme summer conditions occurred disproportionately in lakes with warmer average surface temperatures and during periods of extreme heat. In contrast, we observe no relationships between current thermal extremes and die-offs attributed to infectious disease, direct human perturbations, or winter environmental conditions. We forecast summer fish die-offs for north temperate lakes to double by mid-century (2041-2059) and increase more than six-fold by late century (2081-2099), particularly at southern latitudes. These results expose a direct link between novel temperature regimes and the increased probability of catastrophic ecological events in freshwater ecosystems.
